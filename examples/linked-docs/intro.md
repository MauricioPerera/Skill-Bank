# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. For a comprehensive overview, see [[AI History]].

## Types of Learning

There are three main paradigms:

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. For more details, see [Supervised Learning Guide](supervised.md#overview).

Common algorithms include:
- [Linear Regression](algorithms.md#linear-regression)
- [Decision Trees](algorithms.md#decision-trees)
- [Neural Networks](#neural-networks)

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Learn more in the [Unsupervised Learning Guide](unsupervised.md).

### Reinforcement Learning

Agents learn through interaction with an environment. See [[Reinforcement Learning]] for details.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes.

For deep learning architectures, refer to [Deep Learning Guide](deep-learning.md#architectures).

### Backpropagation

The backpropagation algorithm is fundamental to training neural networks. It efficiently computes gradients using the chain rule.

Mathematical details are covered in [Training Algorithms](algorithms.md#backpropagation).
